# Automated-ChessBoard

# Techievince 8.0, Electronics Club IITG Project

# Overview
- Designed a chessboard, with a AI opponent and capable of moving the chess pieces on its own. Major Tech used are Arduino, Embedded C and for AI Micro Max chess program is used based on Minimax and Alpha-Beta algorithms. The AI played the role of computer and it could move the pieces on its own, it could also detect our moves and make a sound if invalid move is played. Human to human mode was also present.

# Introduction
- The idea of the project is to create a hardware computerized chess game which can be played without any screen and reduces our screen time.
- Chess is a game of intelligence and strategy, but playing it always on screen makes it boring.
- The objective  of this project is to maintain the same thrill of offline chess with the advantage of a computer player.

# Methodology
- All the chess pieces were magnetized and a electromagnet is used to move the pieces. The electromagnet is placed on a XY trolley which uses two stepper motors, one for X direction and other for Y direction.

- The magnet motorization is based on core XY concept. Two motors along with belts are used to move following the X and Y axes. The main advantage of the Core XY concept compared to cartesian kinematics is to avoid having a motoron board the trolley beam. Thus the horizoontal beam is more compact and allow to have a bigger working envelope.

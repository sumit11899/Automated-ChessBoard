# Automated-ChessBoard

# Techievince 8.0, Electronics Club IITG Project

# Overview
- Designed a chessboard, with a AI opponent and capable of moving the chess pieces on its own. Major Tech used are Arduino, Embedded C and for AI Micro Max chess program is used based on Minimax and Alpha-Beta algorithms. The AI played the role of computer and it could move the pieces on its own, it could also detect our moves and make a sound if invalid move is played. Human to human mode was also present.
